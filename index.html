		A volcano is defined as a conical landform or mountain containing one or more
		vents fed by magma rising directly from great depths within the earth. They can be a
		destructive force that brings forth death and despair while also bringing about renewal
		and prosperity. Volcanoes have formed the continents that humans thrive on today as
		well as outgassed water from the mantle to create the atmosphere; they also produce
		fertile soil and mineral deposits in their wake in addition to geothermal energy.
		Nevertheless, these structures have killed thousands of people and even destroyed
		entire cities and ecosystems.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are approximately 1,500 potentially active volcanoes on land today and
		even more that are lying dormant. Counting the ones on the ocean floor, the number of
		volcanoes on planet Earth increase to tens of thousands. Geologists have grouped
		these various volcanoes into four main kinds: 
			<ol> 
				<li>Cinder Cones</li>
				<li>Lava Domes</li>
				<li>Composite Volcano</li>
				<li>Shield Volcano</li>
			</ol>
	<p>Each volcano is comprised of unique characteristics consisting of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Magma Composition</li>
				<li>Viscosity</li> 
				<li>Explosiveness</li>
				<li>Gas Content</li>
			</ul>
	</p>
	<p> 
		Cinder cones are the simplest volcanoes and are built from pieces of solidified
		lava released from only one vent; the lava breaks into small fragments that congeal and
		fall as cinders around the vent to form an ovular cone. Additionally, they often occur in
		groups, have steep slope angle, and are rather small. On the other hand, shield
		volcanoes are built almost entirely of lava flows that pour out in all directions from one
		or more vents and pile up thousands of lava flows that cool in order to become thin, flat
		sheets. This accretion of sheets resemble that of a warrior's shield, resulting in some of
		the largest volcanoes in the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, lava domes are formed by spherical bodies of lava too thick to flow
		great distances which end up piling over and around its vent upon extrusion. These
		volcanic structures occur mainly in the craters or flanks of composite volcanoes. In
		regards to composite volcanoes, they are some of the most violent volcanoes and are
		known as stratovolcanoes. They are usually steep, large, symmetrical cones built of
		fluctuating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, bombs, and any other
		volcanic projectiles. Most composite volcanoes have a crater at its zenith which
		contains one or more vents, but what these structures are most known for are their
		conduit system through which magma from a reservoir deep in the Earth's crust rises to
		the surface. The image below is Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica, an example of a 
		stratovolcano.

		With all their similarities, volcanoes are grouped by geologists based on many
		factors that discern them from one another. As mentioned previously, these factors are
		magma composition, viscosity, explosiveness, and gas content.
		Magma composition refers to the types and abundances of constituent minerals that 
		can determine where the magma was formed. Basaltic and gabbroic magmas,
		for example, have a SiO2 content of fifty percent and become molten at 1,200 degrees
		Celsius; they contain high levels of magnesium, iron, and calcium but low quantities of
		potassium and sodium. Andesitic and dioritic magmas have a SiO2 content of sixty percent and become molten at 1,000
		degrees Celsius. They are comprised of medium amounts of magnesium, iron, and
		calcium but low potassium and sodium. Rhyolitic and granitic
		magmas have seventy percent SiO2 content as well as a melting point of 900
		degrees Celsius. They consist of low magnesium, iron, and calcium distribution but high
		sodium and potassium. With this information in mind, these
		magmas form igneous rock, or solid lava/magma, when they cool down; there are two
		kinds of igneous rocks, intrusive and extrusive, that differ in grain size and cooling
		speed.

		In regards to viscosity and gas content, they both play a role in how destructive a
		volcanic eruption can be. Viscosity is defined as a materialâ€™s resistance to flow, or
		thickness in other words, and gas content refers to how much gas, usually carbon
		dioxide and water vapor, magma contains. Viscosity is increased with less heat, more
		silica, and more escaped gas. High viscosity along with high gas content creates the
		volcanic eruptions people hear about in history books with thick, sluggish lava flows and
		explosive activity that releases huge sulfur clouds with hot debris particles called
		pyroclasts. Low viscosity along with low gas content is the opposite; the lava flows are
		quick and fluid because the trapped gas is not released which results in no gas
		explosion.
